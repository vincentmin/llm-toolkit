## Large Language Models framework

This package contains some simple classes that help you interact with LLM. Creating prompts and feeding them to a LLM of choice is a breeze with this package. Creating chains of LLMs is made easy too.

## TODO

- Implement an actual LLM, such as OpenAI
- Add vector store support
- Allow for more input types than just strings. For example, `List[String]`.
- Allow for passthrough of inputs not to the first runnable, but runnables further down the chain.
